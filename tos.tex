\section*{Welcome to Student Robotics}

Thank you for registering for Student Robotics! This document is a guide intended to
be read by teachers or other adults who are submitting a team to the competition. It
covers how the competition is structured, what goes on throughout the Student Robotics
year, what we provide, and what we require from you.


\subsection*{Who's who}

The people who run Student Robotics (often referred to as ``the blueshirts'')
are a collection of engineers, scientists and students who share a passion for
promoting engineering and education for young people. All volunteers, we work
together to help bring the experience of a substantial and creative engineering
project to those considering studying STEM subjects or working in the industry.

The competitors are any 16-18 year old pupils who are interested in learning
about robotics, electronics and programming. We don't require that they all
come from the same school or college, or are even in education, only that
they're interested in learning and building a robot. Together, in a group of at
least three competitors, they form a team who'll be building a robot to compete
at our competition.

You should be a teacher, parent, or other adult who is authorised to take
responsibility for the competitors. You'll be co-ordinating with us to get the
team to events and the competition, and supporting the team with any local
logistics (for example access to tools or workspace).

\subsection*{Keeping in contact}

The primary method that we use to provide support to teams is through mentors
and via the website forum, see below. If you have any non-technical questions
or enquiries that are unanswered or not suitable for those support channels,
please contact our organising committee at \url{info@studentrobotics.org}. If
you have a particularly urgent enquiry, please contact Jeremy Morse on
07XXXXXXXXX.

\section*{What Student Robotics provides}

To help the team build a robot for our competition, Student Robotics provides
an electronics kit that makes controlling devices and sensors simple. The kit,
in combination with a vision system and a Python programming environment,
makes it easy to build a self-controlled robot. The exact pieces of equipment
in the kit change from year to year, but details can be found in the ``kit''
section of the documentation on our
website.\footnote{\url{https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/}}
We also provide detailed documentation of what the equipment is capable of,
and how to go about programming it.

An exact manifest of what the kit contains, and what you will need to return
at the end of the competition, will be in the competition rulebook published
at Kickstart.

Our electronics kit is on loan for the course of the competition. All of the
kit must be returned at the competition, unless you arrange to extend the loan
for a longer period (please see the rulebook once it is published for details).
Unfortunately we are not in a position to let anyone permanently keep the kit.

\subsection*{Online resources}

As well as the documentation for our equipment, we also provide an online
forum\footnote{\url{https://www.studentrobotics.org/forum}} for competitors,
team leaders and blueshirts to discuss the competition, ask technical questions,
and receive support.

We also provide an online development
environment\footnote{\url{https://www.studentrobotics.org/ide}} for competitors
to robot code, and export it to their robot. This development environment
(``The IDE'') has a code checker to catch errors early, and keeps all the
teams robot code in one place to avoid code getting lost. We also occasionally
ship software updates for the robot via the IDE.

The website is also used for competitors to return media consent forms, and
get their ticket to the competition. We require each competitor to have their
own account on the website -- accounts are created by you, the team leader,
through the user management
page.\footnote{\url{https://www.studentrobotics.org/userman/}} Documentation
for using the user management page is XXX I need to upload this.

\subsection*{Events}

There are two primary events that we organise in the Student Robotics year --
Kickstart introduces the competition to the competitors, and reveals what this
years game will be. The kit is distributed to teams, and we run a series of
challenges to get the teams putting the kit together and learning how it works.

The competition is a \textbf{two day} event, typically held on a weekend in
April. After some initial tinker time, robots are pitted against each other in
an arena in a series of league matches, followed by knock-out matches to find
who has the best robot. Many robots show exciting behaviours, and most teams
significantly improve their robot code across the course of the competition
weekend.

Between the two, several ``tech days'' are run by our local volunteers who.
These are days where your team can meet the other teams from the area, other SR
blueshirts, and ask questions and get advice on how to go about building their
robot. The exact format and dates of these events are locally arranged.

\subsection*{Mentoring}

We believe that the best way to support teams building robots is to have a
mentor, who can give advice on anything from time management to motor and wheel
selection. Unfortunately our limited resources means we can't deliver mentoring
to everyone. We aim to send a mentor (in person) to you on a regular basis if
you can be reached by public transport from the University of Southampton or
Bristol within 45 minutes. If you're futher out, we'll try to arrange a
volunteer to keep in contact with the team and provide remote mentoring,
through whatever means you find convenient.

\subsection*{Budget}

We also provide a small budget to offset the cost of buying components such as
motors and wheels. The amount of the budget changes from year to year, and an
up to date information will be on the support page of the
website\footnote{\url{https://www.studentrobotics.org/schools/support}}. We
can only reimburse purchases for which you have a receipt or invoice, and that
were for parts of the robot.

\section*{What we require from you}

 * Recruit a team
 * Responsibility for build, co-ordinate on ground
   * Don't build a robot for them.
 * Arrange responsible people
 * Arrange transport etc
 * Return the kit.
 * risks / H/S
 * Accounts munging
 

We, the Student Robotics contributors ('the blueshirts') organize and
operate the Student Robotics Competition ('the competition'), an
engineering challenge for 16-18 year olds. We provide an electronics kit
('the kit') on loan, software tools, documentation and support to help
the competitors build a robot that performs a task -- free of charge.

The robot task ('the game') is set at the beginning of the academic year
at the Kickstart event, after which the competitors have several months
to build their robots, in schools at at home. 'Tech day' support
sessions are available at various locations during the build period. At
the end of this period a competition is held to test how their robots
perform. These events will all announced on our website (see the 'key
dates' section) and operated by our contributors [[1]]. We will also
provide our own risk assessments for the events in advance [[2]].

Our primary means of support is via the website, which contains
documentation for all our equipment and our programming environment. The
website also has a forum for competitors to ask questions and discuss
ideas, and the IDE, a web page for writing code for the robot. To access
some of these resources, competitors will be provided with personal
accounts. To maintain these accounts, we store the following pieces of data:
 * First name,
 * Last name,
 * Contact email address,
 * Which team/school the competitors is part of.

We will not share any of this information with third parties, except
when printing participation certificates, when we will send a list of
names to our printers. The email address will only be used to send
(infrequent) bulk organization email to students, although in
exceptional circumstances we may email the student directly regarding
something they've done on the website.

[Do we want to say anything about mentoring?]

~

To make the whole competition happen, we also need you, the 'team
leader', to take responsibility for a number of things. Foremost of
these is the care of the competitors: while we provide a safe [[1]]
environment at all our events, we are not able to provide parental
responsibility. It is up to you to get parental permission and
arrange/provide suitable supervision at our events. For this reason, we
require you to not be competing in the competition yourself [[3]].

We are also unable to provide transportation, meals or accommodation  at
any of the events. (Note that the competition is 2 days long).

You are also responsible for ensuring competitor safety during the robot
build period, such as the safe use of tools. The electronics kit we
provide is mostly safe, however the batteries provided can be dangerous
if mistreated. We will provide a risk assessment [[2]] explaining this,
along with battery charging instructions [[4]].

Please also ensure that the kit is treated carefully -- while we expect
some breakage to occur over the competition period, and can provide
spares, we would prefer this to be kept to a minimum.

Many teams wish to keep their kit after the competition event, to
demonstrate their robot or otherwise work with it. Please let us know
before the competition if the team wish to keep it for a longer period,
and we can arrange a mutually agreeable return date. Unfortunately, we
are not in a position to let anyone keep the kit permanently, or sell
it. If you keep the kit after the competition, you will need to return
the kit at your own expense -- if posted, please ensure it is registered
delivery, with at least £500 worth of insurance.

We will also need you to supply the competitor account data (described
above) to an online web form, so that we can create competitors
accounts. Please ensure that competitors use their own account when
accessing the website: in the (extremely) rare case of an account being
abused we will disable the account, and we'd rather not lock the whole
team out in the process.
